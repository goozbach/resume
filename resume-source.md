## Experience
### [UserTesting][] -- Staff Software Engineer / Ops and Infrastructure Team Lead -- Mar 2021 - Mar 2023
Staff operations engineer leading a team of seven engineers supporting and
maintaining a large legacy code-base.
Architected a Kubernetes and Terraform based platform for microservice
deployment.

* Managed team backlog and quarterly project planning, maintaining a balance
    between new infrastructure related projects and legacy maintenance
    needs while paying down technical debt
* Created best-practices for the engineering department as well as leading our
    DevOps and Cross-Squad Architecture Guilds
* Interfaced with the security team ensuring the company met its compliance
    requirements (SOC2, SOX, GDPR, and ISO27001)
* Developed tooling to improve developer experience
    + Built reusable workflows for both GitHub Actions and CircleCI, reducing
        the amount of CI/CD code the developer would have to create and maintain
    + Created a standardized application infrastructure to reduce the time
        required to deploy new microservices to non-production environments
    + Migrated a well used internal tool from Heroku to internally hosted
        Kubernetes, reducing cost and complexity while improving security
* Maintained legacy application infrastructure including an AWS Elastic Container
    Service (ECS) cluster
* Designed a new application platform based on Kubernetes using Amazon Elastic
    Kubernetes Service -- EKS

### [Nav][] -- Principal Software Engineer DevOps -- Aug 2017 - Feb 2021
Principal software engineer with a focus on DevOps, architected, deployed and
maintained the infrastructure platform for a late-stage fintech startup.
Architected and oversaw migration of a mid-sized traditional Amazon AWS infrastructure
into Kubernetes hosted on AWS.

* Mitigated legacy architecture problems using automation(Ansible), security tools
    (HashiCorp Vault), and a systems operations background.
    + Created a tool called [vault_helper][][^1] to ease the rotation of encryption
        keys of the HashiCorp Vault system.
* Built new Kubernetes platform and migrated legacy applications onto it.
    + Built architecture to allow legacy apps and new (k8s) apps to communicate
        as if they were on the same platform.
* Improved developer workflow processes and tooling.
    + Created company-wide engineering standards, such as a JSON logging
        standard, secret management and code release workflows
    + Built a "canary application" which tested and exercised all the possible
        features of the platform.
    + Built a centralized CI/CD pipeline system to standardize deployment pipelines.
        This enabled developers to focus on their application code, not deployment
        artifacts and scripts.
    + Migrated all infrastructure creation from an ad-hoc solution to HashiCorp
        Terraform. Enabling repeatable and better maintainable infrastructure.
    + Implemented RunDocs for every application, bringing operations and
        development closer into alignment. This also increased the resiliency
        for the running applications.
