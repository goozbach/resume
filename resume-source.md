## Experience
### [UserTesting][] -- Staff Software Engineer / Ops and Infrastructure Team Lead -- Mar 2021 - Mar 2023
As a staff operations engineer and team lead, I lead a team of seven engineers
supporting and maintaining a large legacy code-base.
Architected a Kubernetes and Terraform based platform for microservice
deployment.

* Managed team backlog and quarterly project planning, maintaining a balance
    between new infrastructure related projects and legacy maintenance
    needs while paying down technical debt
* Created best-practices for the engineering department as well as leading our
    DevOps and Cross-Squad Architecture Guilds
* Interfaced with the security team ensuring the company met its compliance
    requirements (SOC2, SOX, GDPR, and ISO27001)
* Developed tooling to improve developer experience
    + Built reusable workflows for both GitHub Actions and CircleCI, reducing
        the amount of CI/CD code the developer would have to create and maintain
    + Created a standardized application infrastructure to reduce the time
        required to deploy new microservices to non-production environments
* Maintained legacy application infrastructure including an AWS Elastic Container
    Service (ECS) cluster
* Maintained our custom ruby-on-rails deployment application, migrating it
    from Heroku to a self-hosted Kubernetes environment, reducing overall
    operations cost as well as improving our security
* Designed a new application platform based on Kubernetes (Amazon Elastic
    Kubernetes Service -- EKS)
    + Separated production and non-production workloads into different AWS
        accounts

### [Nav][] -- Principal Software Engineer DevOps -- Aug 2017 - Feb 2021
As a principal software engineer with a focus on DevOps, I architected,
deployed and maintained the infrastructure platform for a late-stage fintech
startup.
Architected and oversaw migration of a mid-sized traditional Amazon AWS infrastructure
into Kubernetes hosted on AWS.

* Mitigated legacy architecture problems using automation(Ansible), security tools
    (HashiCorp Vault), and my systems operations background.
    + Built a new Ansible architecture to standardize the settings, security,
        and management of legacy(EC2) infrastructure servers.
    + Created a tool called [vault_helper][][^1] to ease the rotation of encryption
        keys of the HashiCorp Vault system.
    + Centralized audit logging and user management for HashiCorp Vault.
        This increased security, accountability, and auditability of the secret
        storage and encryption systems.

* Built new Kubernetes platform and migrated legacy applications onto it.
    + Built architecture to allow legacy apps and new (k8s) apps to communicate
        as if they were on the same platform.
    + Standardized a containerization workflow to allow for better security
        and maintainability.
    + Enabled containerized applications to leverage HashiCorp Vault's
        encryption as a service to secure customer data.
    + Assisted developers in migrating their legacy applications to the new
        platform with minimal downtime.

* Improved developer workflow processes and tooling.
    + Created company-wide engineering standards
        - JSON based logging standard
        - Secret management and encryption standards
        - Standard for the proper use of non-production (QA, integration,
            staging, and sandbox) environments.
    + Built a "canary application" which tested and exercised all the possible
        features of the platform.
        This enabled testing of CI/CD pipelines and environments without
        involving production applications
    + Built a centralized CI/CD pipeline system to standardize deployment pipelines.
        This enabled developers to focus on their application code, not deployment
        artifacts and scripts.
    + Built CI/CD pipeline tooling to automate common tasks
        - Creation of databases with their corresponding users
        - Create master database user/password and store secrets into HashiCorp
            Vault
    + Migrated all infrastructure creation from an ad-hoc solution to HashiCorp
        Terraform. Enabling repeatable and better maintainable infrastructure.
    + Implemented RunDocs for every application, bringing operations and
        development closer into alignment. This also increased the resiliency
        for the running applications.
