I'm looking for the next step in my career.

My ideal engagement is to be a team lead for an infrastructure and platform team.
Working hand-in-hand with the product architect to build a scalable, reliable, fast infrastructure.

Reporting to a Director or VP of engineering to turn strategy into tactics.
