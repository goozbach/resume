Dear {hiring_manager_name},

My name is {firstname} {lastname} and I'm a cloud infrastructure and DevOps
specialist with twenty-four years of experience.
I came across your {role_name} posting from {role_source}, and I'm sharing my
interest in helping {company_name} reach it's goal of {role_description}.

My most recent experience was leading a team of seven operations and DevOps
engineers at UserTesting to create and socialize a new Kubernetes based platform.
I improved developer productivity, while reducing costs by implementing DevOps
related practices and tooling.

Prior to that, I was a Staff Engineer at Nav inc. and architected a full DevOps and
CI/CD pipeline to migrate the engineering org from a platform of hand-maintained
servers to a Kubernetes based platform.

I'd be a great asset to the team at {company_name}.
As a Linux instructor I have honed my skills around explaining complex topics
to a wide audience. These skills will help me represent {company_name} in a favorable
light, both in-person and digitally.

I'm attaching my resume, and you can find my entire work history on my LinkedIn
profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/goozbach/

I look forward to hearing from you and wish you the best.

Sincerely,

Derek Carter
