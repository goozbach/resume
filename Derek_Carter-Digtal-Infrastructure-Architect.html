<p>Senior DevOps Team lead and DevOps Team Manager spearheading a migration to devops workflows and principles for the entire engineering organization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced an Request for Comments(RFC) process for formalizing engineering decisions.</li>
<li>Migrated from hosted GitHub code hosting to internally hosted GitLab server.
<ul>
<li>Created engineering-wide CI/CD workflows for managing development, testing and deployment of microservices</li>
<li>Created internal-only CI/CD runners to ensure our code only ran on company owned hardware.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Introduced the use of Terragrunt and multiple environments into existing terraform infrastructure, allowing for ease of deploying infrastructure into different environments.</li>
<li>Created new multi-environment deployments to better separate dev, staging, and production workflows. Introduced new internal-only domains to reduce environment confusion.</li>
<li>Introduced better Role Based Access Control(RBAC) backed by Terraform and terragrunt to increase security and reduce human error when creating roles or adding users to roles.</li>
<li>Managed a team of two with a third rotating “DevOps Residency” program to help spread devops principles through the entire engineering organization.</li>

<li>Developed tooling to improve developer experience
<ul>
<li>Built reusable workflows for both GitHub Actions and CircleCI, reducing the amount of CI/CD code the developer would have to create and maintain</li>
<li>Created a standardized application infrastructure to reduce the time required to deploy new microservices to non-production environments</li>
<li>Migrated a well used internal tool from Heroku to internally hosted Kubernetes, reducing cost and complexity while improving security</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maintained legacy application infrastructure including an AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster</li>
<li>Designed a new application platform based on Kubernetes using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service – EKS</li>
</ul>

<p>Principal software engineer with a focus on DevOps, architected, deployed and maintained the infrastructure platform for a late-stage fintech startup. Architected and oversaw migration of a mid-sized traditional Amazon AWS infrastructure into Kubernetes hosted on AWS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mitigated legacy architecture problems using automation(Ansible), security tools (HashiCorp Vault), and a systems operations background.
<ul>
<li>Created a tool called <a href="https://gitlab.com/goozbach/vault_helper">vault_helper</a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> to ease the rotation of encryption keys of the HashiCorp Vault system.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Built architecture to allow legacy apps and new (k8s) apps to communicate as if they were on the same platform.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Improved developer workflow processes and tooling.
<ul>
<li>Created company-wide engineering standards, such as a JSON logging standard, secret management and code release workflows</li>
<li>Built a “canary application” which tested and exercised all the possible features of the platform.</li>
<li>Built a centralized CI/CD pipeline system to standardize deployment pipelines. This enabled developers to focus on their application code, not deployment artifacts and scripts.</li>
<li>Migrated all infrastructure creation from an ad-hoc solution to HashiCorp Terraform. Enabling repeatable and better maintainable infrastructure.</li>
<li>Implemented RunDocs for every application, bringing operations and development closer into alignment. This also increased the resiliency for the running applications.</li>
