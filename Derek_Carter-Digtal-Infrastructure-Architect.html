<h3 id="nav-principal-software-engineer-devops-aug-2017---feb-2021"><a href="http://nav.com">Nav</a> – Principal Software Engineer DevOps – Aug 2017 - Feb 2021</h3>
<p>As a principal software engineer with a focus on DevOps, I architected, deployed and maintained the infrastructure platform for a late-stage fintech startup. Architected and oversaw migration of a mid-sized traditional Amazon AWS infrastructure into Kubernetes hosted on AWS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mitigated legacy architecture problems using automation(Ansible), security tools (HashiCorp Vault), and my systems operations background.
<ul>
<li>Built a new Ansible architecture to standardize the settings, security, and management of legacy(EC2) infrastructure servers.</li>
<li>Created a tool called <a href="https://gitlab.com/goozbach/vault_helper">vault_helper</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> to ease the rotation of encryption keys of the HashiCorp Vault system.</li>
<li>Centralized audit logging and user management for HashiCorp Vault. This increased security, accountability, and auditability of the secret storage and encryption systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Built new Kubernetes platform and migrated legacy applications onto it.
<ul>
<li>Built architecture to allow legacy apps and new (k8s) apps to communicate as if they were on the same platform.</li>
<li>Standardized a containerization workflow to allow for better security and maintainability.</li>
<li>Built container environment tooling to allow for multiple environments using the same  image.</li>
<li>Enabled containerized applications to leverage HashiCorp Vault’s encryption as a service to secure customer data.</li>

<ul>
<li>JSON based logging standard</li>
<li>Secret management and encryption standards</li>
<li>Standard for the proper use of non-production (QA, integration, staging, and sandbox) environments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Built a “canary application” which tested and exercised all the possible features of the platform. This enabled testing of CI/CD pipelines and environments without involving production applications</li>
<li>Built a centralized CI/CD pipeline system to standardize deployment pipelines. This enabled developers to focus on their application code, not deployment artifacts and scripts.</li>
<li>Built CI/CD pipeline tooling to automate common tasks
<ul>
<li>Creation of databases with their corresponding users</li>
<li>Create master database user/password and store secrets into HashiCorp Vault</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Migrated all infrastructure creation from an ad-hoc solution to HashiCorp Terraform. Enabling repeatable and better maintainable infrastructure.</li>
<li>Implemented RunDocs for every application, bringing operations and development closer into alignment. This also increased the resiliency for the running applications.</li>
